# Language-Driven Design (LDD) Manifesto üöÄ

## Introduction üåü

In today's complex and ever-changing world of software, system design goes beyond just coding or technical architecture. High-quality software systems reflect the language and concepts of the real world. In **Language-Driven Design (LDD)**, we believe that a precise and clear language forms the foundation of systems that are not only effective in functionality but are also understandable and interactive for all stakeholders. In this approach, domain language plays a central role in reducing complexity, facilitating communication, and aligning teams. 
LDD goes beyond technical architecture design and focuses on human interactions, especially the effective communication between technical and non-technical teams. We see clarity, simplification, and the evolution of language as the key to successful software systems.

**Why LDD?**

* **Bridging Gaps:** LDD focuses on human interactions, fostering seamless communication between technical and non-technical teams.
* **Simplifying Complexity:** We leverage language to streamline processes and demystify intricate systems.
* **Evolving with You:** We embrace language evolution, ensuring our systems remain relevant and adaptable.
  
## Principles of Language-Driven Design (LDD) üìú

1. **Language Is The Foundation Of Software Systems:**  
   * Software systems reflect the language governing their operational domain. Ambiguities or deficiencies in language lead to ambiguities or deficiencies in the system.

2. **Accurate Models Are Based On Clear Language:**  
   * Every entity, service, or process in the system should reflect a distinct concept from the domain language. The system's architecture should reflect the business language, not just a set of technical elements.

3. **Clarity In Language Over Ambiguity:**  
   * Multiple interpretations of a term cause confusion. Therefore, clarity in language is a high priority. Every term should have a unique meaning, and every concept should be clear and well-defined.

4. **Language Is A Dynamic And Evolving Entity:**  
   * Changes in business and user needs necessitate the evolution of domain language. Continuous documentation, analysis, and updates to the language are essential to align with reality.

5. **The System Architecture Must Reflect The Domain Language:**  
   * The boundaries of the system architecture should align with the conceptual boundaries of the domain language. Each service, module, or API should represent a clear concept from the domain language.

6. **Common Language Is A Tool For Communication Between Teams:**  
   * The success of a system, in addition to appropriate code, requires a shared understanding between technical and non-technical teams. A clear and shared language facilitates communication and reduces the gap between these teams.

7. **Naming Is An Architectural Decision:**  
   * Naming entities, services, APIs, and messages in the system is beyond personal preference. Proper naming promotes clarity, reduces complexity, and prevents misunderstandings.

8. **Language Is The Interface Between Humans And Machines:**  
   * The software system must be understandable to both humans and machines. Designing a language that flows in code, documentation, and daily team conversations is crucial.

9. **The Boundaries Of Language Define The Boundaries Of Systems:**  
   * Dividing the system based on technical structure is insufficient. System boundaries should align with the conceptual boundaries of the language and their real-world meaning.

10. **Language Alignment With User Experience Is Essential:**  
    * The language used in system design should align with the language of end-users. The system's terminology should reflect users' understanding of processes and concepts.

11. **The Language Must Be Scalable:**  
    * As the system grows, the language should be extendable. Any changes in the language must be deliberate and controlled.

12. **The Data Model Must Reflect The Domain Language:**  
    * The data model should not be separate from the domain language. Domain language terms should be clearly reflected in the data model.

13. **Language Is A Tool For Reducing Complexity:**  
    * The complexity of software systems often arises from ambiguity in concepts and terms. Designing a clear and precise language reduces unnecessary complexity.

14. **Language As A Tool For Living Documentation:**  
    * Documenting the domain language and all its changes must be continuously and dynamically updated. These documents should be easily accessible and usable by all team members.

15. **Collaboration And Participation Are Key To Achieving A Shared Language:**  
    * Holding brainstorming sessions with all stakeholders (technical teams, users, and managers) is essential to achieve a shared language.

16. **Continuous Feedback Guarantees Language Evolution:**  
    * Continuous feedback from users and stakeholders helps the domain language evolve and adapt to real-world needs.

17. **Avoid Technical Jargon:**  
    * In conversations and documentation, avoid using specialized programming jargon and instead use simple, comprehensible language for everyone.

18. **Language Evolves Over Time:**  
    * Language must always evolve in alignment with new needs and changes in the real world. This process is continuous and carried out in close collaboration with all stakeholders.

19. **Language Interactions Are The Foundation Of Team Interactions:**  
    * A shared language is crucial not only in system design but also in team collaboration. Effective interactions between team members, based on a shared language, can pave the way for more successful project outcomes.

20. **Simplifying Complexities With Language:**  
    * The language should be designed to simplify complexities and make intricate processes more understandable and manageable.

21. **Language Closure is Essential:**
    * At LDD, we aim to maintain the language as small and closed as possible. By adopting the concept of "closure" from mathematics, we avoid introducing unnecessary terms or concepts into the language. This means that the language should evolve only with deliberate and necessary additions, ensuring it remains precise, simple, and free from unnecessary complexity. This closure approach helps us keep the language clear, focused, and effective.

## Conclusion üéâ

In LDD, we believe that software design should be based on a precise, clear, and shared language. This language is not only a tool for development and modeling but also a bridge for collaboration among all team members, from developers to managers and users. We follow these principles to build systems that are not only efficient and scalable but also understandable and interactive for everyone involved. This manifesto forms the foundation of our commitment to designing systems that are simpler, more cohesive, and more effective than ever before.
